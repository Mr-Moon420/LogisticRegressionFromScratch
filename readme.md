The research for building this algorithm was from the book "Data Science from scratch" by Joel Grus.
The book itself avoided the use of libraries, but I have used numpy for vectors and linear algebra, pandas for data manipulation, and sickit-learn for train_test_split and visualizing the confusion matrix.
The working of the algorithm is based on the principle of Maximum Likelihood estimation. The algorithm minimizes the negative log of the likelihood function using gradient descent, thus maximizing the likelihood itself.
